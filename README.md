# IDS (Indigenous Data Sovereignty) Project

## Project Overview

The IDS (Indigenous Data Sovereignty) Project aims to establish a secure, ethical, and culturally sensitive framework for managing and protecting indigenous data, with a focus on genomic information. This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure data sovereignty, transparency, and controlled access to sensitive information.

## Objectives

- Empower indigenous communities with control over their data, especially genomic data
- Ensure ethical use of indigenous information in research and applications
- Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data
- Facilitate collaboration between researchers and indigenous communities
- Preserve cultural heritage through responsible data management

## Technical Stack

- Ethereum blockchain (Goerli testnet for development)
- Hardhat development environment
- Solidity smart contracts
- Node.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ids-project.git
   cd ids-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Available Commands

- Compile smart contracts:
  ```
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

- Run tests:
  ```
  npx hardhat test
  ```

- Run tests with gas reporting:
  ```
  REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
  ```

- Deploy smart contracts to Goerli testnet:
  ```
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
  ```

- Initialize database (after deployment):
  ```
  npx hardhat run scripts/database.js --network goerli
  ```

## Smart Contract Structure

- `DataRegistry.sol`: Manages data ownership and access control
- `ConsentManagement.sol`: Handles consent processes and permissions
- `DataAccess.sol`: Controls data retrieval and usage tracking
